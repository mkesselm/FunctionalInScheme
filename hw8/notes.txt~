5.19_

For my implementation, I approached the problem with the input command in mind.
Since the user sets a break-point a certain distance away from a label, I chose
to check for breaks based on that particular rationale.

I implemented a couple new registers, including a new type of register that is
really a table dedicated to breakpoints. The new registers, that are used, are:
- inst-depth
- current-label
- break-table

There are also some vestigial registers that I had intended to use but ended up
not actually needing:
- resume-flag
- break-limit

Resume flag might still be useful, however, to see if a machine is currently
paused or not.

inst-depth serves the sole purpose of tracking how far from the last label the
machine is. It is reset to 0 every time the machine successfully branches or
runs a goto instruction.

Similarly, current-label tracks the current label the machine is running under.
It does this by first being set to whatever the last label parsed by
extract-labels was. This is guaranteed (at least from my observation) to be the
first label, due to the nature of extract-labels--I'm not sure why, unfortunately
the textbook does a really garbage job at documenting the how of this procedure,
though I am adequately impressed at the authors' cleverness. When that last
label is extracted, I load it into variable as well (since I had a hard time
figuring out the scoping with this). In (execute), if current-label register is
still unassigned, I load it with the value from the global holder, and then
clear that holder out (this is similar to how I dealt with 5.9).

Every time (execute) is called, it increments the inst-depth register first. It
then checks the break-table register (which I modeled off the standard register)
for the argument containing the current-label and inst-depth register passed as
a pair. If it finds a hit, the program exits to terminal, rather than continuing
with the execute procedure.

My break-table register is basically a procedure containing a list and a
dispatch--similar to registers. It has a few more dispatches than the normal
registers, though. It can:
- clear to empty
- remove a single entry
- output all entries
- receive a new entry

All breakpoints are stored as label-number pairs. They are passed into the
break-table in a fashion very similar to a registers set-register-contents, but
there is no need for the register lookup step, as there is always only a single
break-table.

When (execute) is called on an expression, the head (or, the cadaar really) is
checked if it is a pair. If it is, it is checked if it is a goto or a branch.
If it is a goto, the register is automatically updated, and the inst-depth is
reset to 0 before proceeding on as normal. If it is a branch, the flag register
is checked and, if flipped, the same process mentioned occurs--otherwise no
change occurs, as there is no new label.

Resume works by basically running (execute) in its original form. As the machine
has already incremented the appropriate register and the label should still be
the same, there is no reason to do anything except execute. The break-table
can't be checked first or the machine would pause again. While the machine is
paused, all normal register and break-table checks are available--breaks can be
removed or added as well at this time.
