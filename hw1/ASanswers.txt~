;;For all of my procedures, I simply tested by passing at least one base case value and one, or more
;;higher case values.  I made sure to test the same cases in both the recursive and iterative versions.
;;However, I was unable to design a functioning iterative version of the 1.11 function.

;;For 1.12, I provided the 0 0  case to test the lower end and discovered I needed to place a simple
;;conditional just to ensure that 0 0  is calculated correctly.  Following that, I used the nCr formula
;;to find the respective element in the triangle, which required factorial calculations, thus fulfilling
;;the supplied criteria of the problem.
